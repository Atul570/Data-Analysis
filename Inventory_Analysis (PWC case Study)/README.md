# 📊 Inventory Analysis Project

An end-to-end project where I analyzed 267,552 product inventories to evaluate stock movement, procurement patterns, and sales performance using **SQL, MySQL, and Power BI**.

## 🚀 Project Highlights

- ✅ **267,552 inventories** analyzed to detect stock movement, procurement efficiency, and sales alignment.
- ✅ Identified **3,790 deadstock** items worth **$850K (zero sales)**. Proposed strategies projected to unlock **$8.22M** in revenue (~**1.82%** of total sales).
- ✅ Engineered **purchase gap analysis** using SQL (**LEAD/LAG, DATEDIFF**), classifying **47,020 active SKUs** into Overstocked, Understocked, Balanced.
- ✅ Built **Power BI dashboards** connected with MySQL views — visualizing **ABC category trends**, vendor performance, and flagging underperforming brands.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **SQL** (MySQL)
- **Power BI** (visualization)
- **Excel** (cross-validation)
- **Python** *(optional for future automation)*

## 📂 Project Steps

1. **Data Acquisition**: Pulled 1-year sales and purchase data (12,825,363 sales records, 276.39K inventory units).
2. **Data Modeling**: Uploaded raw data into MySQL, created views/tables using SQL joins, aggregation, LEAD/LAG functions.
3. **Inventory Movement Analysis**:
    - Beginning vs Ending Inventory comparison
    - Dropped, newly added, and deadstock identification
4. **Procurement Efficiency**:
    - Purchase vs Sales timing check
    - Stocking behavior classified (Overstocked, Understocked, Balanced)
5. **Power BI Dashboards**:
    - ABC Category trends
    - Vendor-level contribution
    - Brand-level underperformance detection

## 📈 Key Results

- **3,790** items found unsold ➡️ Potential saving of **$850K**
- Opportunity to generate **$8.22M** more sales (~1.82% boost)
- Monitored stock efficiency across **47,020 active SKUs**
- Visual reports enabled **data-driven procurement decisions**

## 🏷️ Resume Bullet (Sample)

- Analyzed 267,552 inventories, flagged 3,790 deadstock items worth $850K, recommending replacements projected to generate $8.22M (+1.82% sales impact).
- Built SQL model mapping 100K+ purchase events, classifying 47,020 SKUs as Overstocked, Understocked, Balanced, optimizing procurement cycles.
- Delivered Power BI dashboards connected to MySQL, visualizing ABC trends, vendor performance, and underperforming brands.
