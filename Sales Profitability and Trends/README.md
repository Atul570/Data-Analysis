## Insight:-
  - This data highlights the profitability of various product sub-categories. Copiers lead with the highest profit of $55,617.82, followed by Phones and Accessories. Sub-categories like Paper and Binders also contribute significant profits. On the other hand, Tables and Bookcases show notable losses, with Tables incurring a loss of $17,725.5.

- Based on the analysis of the Tables subcategory, we observe a moderately strong negative correlation of -0.67 between discount and profitability. This means that as discounts increase, profitability tends to decline significantly.

- In the bookcase subcategory, the Consumer segment has incurred a significant loss of $4,435.64 over 131 transactions, while the Home Office and Corporate segments have shown profits of $324.63 and $638.45 from 33 and 64 transactions, respectively.

- There is a correlation of -0.63 between discount levels and total profit, indicating that as discounts increase, total profit tends to decrease, negatively impacting overall profitability.

- Discounts below 30% (0.3) can lead to positive profitability, as seen with a profit of $1,418.99 at a 0.15 discount, while discounts of 0.4 and above result in increasing losses.

- Both discount levels and profitability are influenced by the number of orders; for example, at a 0.7 discount, there are 391 orders resulting in a loss of -$39,643.72, while at a 0.8 discount, with only 285 orders, the loss increases to -$30,136.24. This illustrates how higher discounts, combined with fewer orders, lead to significant losses.

- We have successfully delivered order across 49 State. Of these, 39 state have been profitable, while 10 state have experienced losses.

- The tables highlights the Top 5 Loss-Making and Top 5 Profitable States, showing total losses or profits for each state. It also includes the number of cities in each state that are either loss-making or profitable. This provides a quick snapshot of state and city-level performance.

## Recommendation:-

- Discount Strategy for Tables:-
  + Cease offering discounts on tables in general. If discounts must be given, restrict them to small discounts in the states of Washington, New York, and Virginia.
- Bookcase Subcategory Discount Adjustments:
  + Discontinue discounts for the Consumer segment in the states of Pennsylvania, Texas, Colorado, Ohio, and Arizona.
- Customer Base Expansion:-
  + Focus efforts on increasing the customer base in Wyoming, Kansas, South Dakota, and North Dakota.
- Texas:-
  + Reassess the pricing strategy for binders and appliances, and consider discontinuing aggressive promotions or discounts to improve profitability.
